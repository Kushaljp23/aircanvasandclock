# aircanvasandclock

1 First of all install python and opencv in ur device

Then Run the code for Air Canvas and take a object like or finger tip (e.g blue color pen)

If u have not set the value of HSV then set it when the program runs so the object can be detected

and wave ur hand to enjoy the effect

For Disappearing Cloak initially when u run the program give acces to camera and when camera opens don't show the things which you want to hide and after few seconds take a cloak of unique color and cloak which can be easily detected by the camera and come towards the camera u will observe that the things beside the cloak will be disappeared.
